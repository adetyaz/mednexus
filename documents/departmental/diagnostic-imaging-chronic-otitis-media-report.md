## Patient Information

**Patient ID:** MNH-RAD-2024-1847  
**Age:** 28 years  
**Gender:** Female  
**Clinical History:** Recurrent ear discharge, hearing loss, suspected chronic otitis media

---

## Imaging Study Details

**Study Type:** High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) - Temporal Bone  
**Date of Study:** December 14, 2024  
**Scanner:** 128-slice CT with 0.5mm slice thickness  
**Contrast:** Non-contrast study  
**Indication:** Chronic otitis media evaluation, mastoid assessment

---

## Clinical Findings

### Right Ear (Affected Side)

**Tympanic Membrane:** Complete perforation of pars tensa noted on coronal reconstructions

**Middle Ear Cavity:**

- Fluid accumulation in mesotympanum and epitympanum
- Soft tissue density in the attic region
- Isthmus tympanicum shows complete obstruction by inflammatory tissue
- Tensor tympani fold appears complete and thickened

**Ossicular Chain:**

- Malleus: Medialized position noted
- Incus: Partial erosion of long process
- Stapes: Intact, normal position

**Mastoid Pneumatization:**

- **Classification:** Poorly pneumatized (sclerotic type)
- Pneumatization limited to antral region only
- Extensive sclerotic changes throughout mastoid air cell system
- Mastoid antrum shows fluid collection and mucosal thickening

**Eustachian Tube:** Patent, no obstructive changes identified

### Left Ear (Contralateral - Normal)

- Normal tympanic membrane thickness
- Well-aerated middle ear spaces
- Normal mastoid pneumatization extending to zygomatic and periantral areas
- Intact ossicular chain with normal positioning
- Patent isthmus tympanicum

---

## Quantitative Assessment

### Pneumatization Analysis

**Right Mastoid Volume:** 2.1 cm続 (reduced)  
**Left Mastoid Volume:** 8.7 cm続 (normal)  
**Pneumatization Index:** 24% (severely reduced)

### Ventilation Route Assessment

- **Isthmus Tympanicum Patency:** Blocked (inflammatory obstruction)
- **Tensor Fold Status:** Complete (intact fold noted)
- **Epitympanic Volume:** 0.8 cm続 (reduced from normal 1.4 cm続)

---

## Imaging Correlations

### Endoscopic-CT Correlation

The imaging findings correlate with established patterns of chronic otitis media:

- Blocked isthmus tympanicum (94.1% correlation with poor mastoid pneumatization)
- Complete tensor fold associated with poorly pneumatized mastoid
- Inflammatory soft tissue in epitympanic space consistent with ventilation dysfunction

### Pathophysiology Assessment

1. **Ventilation Blockage:** Isthmus tympanicum obstruction prevents epitympanic aeration
2. **Secondary Changes:** Poor ventilation leads to mucosal inflammation and fluid accumulation
3. **Mastoid Impact:** Chronic dysventilation results in sclerotic mastoid changes

---

## Radiological Impressions

**Primary Diagnosis:**
Chronic otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation (right ear)

**Secondary Findings:**

1. Poorly pneumatized sclerotic mastoid (right side)
2. Blocked isthmus tympanicum with inflammatory obstruction
3. Epitympanic fluid collection and soft tissue thickening
4. Partial ossicular erosion (incus long process)

**Staging Classification:** Marchioni Stage II (Limited attic disease with mastoid involvement)

---

## Clinical Significance

### Surgical Planning Considerations

- Endoscopic approach recommended for isthmus tympanicum clearance
- Tensor fold management may be required to restore ventilation
- Ossiculoplasty indicated for incus reconstruction
- Mastoidectomy not required given limited mastoid involvement

### Ventilation Route Analysis

The blocked isthmus tympanicum is the primary pathological finding contributing to:

- Epitympanic dysventilation syndrome
- Progressive mastoid sclerosis
- Ongoing inflammatory changes

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Management

1. **Surgical Intervention:** Endoscopic tympanoplasty with isthmus clearance
2. **Tensor Fold Management:** Consider opening/removal if complete obstruction confirmed
3. **Ossicular Reconstruction:** PORP (Partial Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis) for incus repair

### Follow-up Imaging

- Post-operative CT in 6 months to assess:
  - Graft integration
  - Pneumatization improvement
  - Absence of recurrent inflammatory changes

### Departmental Protocol Notes

- Case suitable for ENT-Radiology multidisciplinary review
- Recommend endoscopic surgical correlation with imaging findings
- Educational value for resident teaching on chronic otitis media patterns
