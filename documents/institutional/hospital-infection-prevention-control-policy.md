## 3. DEFINITIONS

**Healthcare-Associated Infection (HAI)**: An infection occurring in a patient during the process of care in a hospital or other healthcare facility that was not present or incubating at the time of admission.

**Standard Precautions**: Evidence-based practices designed to both protect healthcare personnel and prevent healthcare personnel from spreading infections among patients.

**Contact Precautions**: Precautions designed to prevent transmission of infectious agents that are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient's environment.

**Droplet Precautions**: Precautions designed to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions.

**Airborne Precautions**: Precautions designed to prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in air.
