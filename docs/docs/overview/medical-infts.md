# Medical Intelligence INFTs

## What are Medical Intelligence INFTs?

Medical Intelligence INFTs are tokenized medical expertise built on the ERC-7857 standard, designed specifically for secure transfer of AI-powered medical knowledge. Unlike traditional NFTs that represent static assets, Medical Intelligence INFTs contain executable medical intelligence that can diagnose, recommend treatments, and guide medical research.

## ERC-7857 Standard for Medical Applications

### Why ERC-7857 is Perfect for Healthcare

**üõ°Ô∏è Privacy-Preserving Metadata**

- Encrypts sensitive medical intelligence data
- Protects proprietary diagnostic algorithms
- Maintains patient privacy throughout transfers

**üîÑ Secure Intelligence Transfer**

- Both ownership AND encrypted medical knowledge transfer together
- Verifiable transfer process ensures diagnostic capability integrity
- New owners receive fully functional medical intelligence

**‚ö° Dynamic Medical Knowledge**

- Supports evolving AI diagnostic capabilities
- Secure updates to medical protocols and treatment algorithms
- Maintains functionality as medical knowledge advances

**üåê Decentralized Medical Storage**

- Integrates with 0G Storage for permanent, tamper-proof medical knowledge
- Distributed access management across global medical network
- No single point of failure for critical medical intelligence

};
```

## Medical INFT Transfer Process

### 1. **Encrypt Medical Intelligence**

```javascript
// Encrypt sensitive diagnostic algorithms and medical data
const encryptedMedicalData = await encryptMedicalIntelligence(
  diagnosticAlgorithm,
  treatmentProtocols,
  patientConsentData,
  institutionPrivateKey
);
```

### 2. **Commit to 0G Storage**

```javascript
// Store encrypted medical intelligence on 0G Storage
const storageResult = await zg.storage.upload({
  data: encryptedMedicalData,
  metadata: {
    type: "medical_intelligence",
    specialty: "cardiology",
    version: "v2.1",
    lastUpdated: Date.now(),
  },
});
```

### 3. **Mint Medical INFT**

```javascript
// Create Medical Intelligence INFT with ERC-7857
const medicalINFT = await medicalINFTRegistry.mintMedicalINFT(
  recipientAddress,
  "pediatric_cardiology",
  storageResult.contentHash,
  contributingInstitutions,
  {
    usageRights: "consultation_and_diagnosis",
    royaltyRate: 500, // 5% to contributing institutions
    updatePermissions: "original_creators_only",
  }
);
```

### 4. **Secure Transfer with Medical Knowledge**

```javascript
// Transfer both ownership and encrypted medical intelligence
const transferResult = await medicalINFTRegistry.safeTransferWithIntelligence(
  fromAddress,
  toAddress,
  tokenId,
  encryptedMedicalData
);
```

### 5. **Verify and Grant Access**

```javascript
// New owner gains access to medical intelligence
const medicalIntelligence = await medicalINFTRegistry.accessMedicalIntelligence(
  tokenId,
  newOwnerPrivateKey
);
```

## Usage Examples

```solidity
// Smart contract automatically distributes revenue
contract MedicalINFTRevenue {
    function distributeMedicalINFTRevenue(
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 totalRevenue
    ) external {
        MedicalIntelligence memory medical = medicalINFTs[tokenId];

        // Distribute to contributing institutions
        for (uint i = 0; i < medical.contributingInstitutions.length; i++) {
            uint256 institutionShare = (totalRevenue * 400) / 10000; // 4%
            payable(medical.contributingInstitutions[i]).transfer(institutionShare);
        }

        // Platform fee
        uint256 platformFee = (totalRevenue * 100) / 10000; // 1%
        payable(platformAddress).transfer(platformFee);

        // Remainder to INFT owner
        uint256 ownerShare = totalRevenue - institutionShare - platformFee;
        payable(ownerOf(tokenId)).transfer(ownerShare);
    }
}
```
