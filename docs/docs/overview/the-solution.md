MedNexus co-locates model artifacts and data with on-chain anchoring and verifiable compute using 0G Storage, 0G Compute, 0G Data Availability (DA), and the 0G EVM-compatible chain. Key elements:

- INFTs: executable tokens that represent AI models (model URI, runtime requirements, versioning, revenue split).
- In-place encrypted compute: models run close to stored, encrypted data; only aggregated/non-identifying outputs are returned where required.
- Consent-first access control: on-chain grants and revocation for time-limited, purpose-limited dataset usage.
- Auditability: DA anchors and compact proofs let auditors verify computations without raw data exposure.
