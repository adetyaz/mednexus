MedNexus is a decentralized data and compute platform built on the 0G modular stack that enables secure, auditable, and privacy-preserving AI workflows for regulated and data-rich industries. We enable users to create, own, and monetize Intelligent Non-Fungible Tokens (INFTs) — live, executable AI models — and to run verifiable computations on encrypted datasets without exposing raw personal data. The product focuses on a no-code visual builder for domain experts and an economically sustainable marketplace for INFTs and datasets.
