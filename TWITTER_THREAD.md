## Tweet 1 - Intro Hook

🏥 I built MedNexus: A decentralized medical intelligence platform that connects doctors worldwide in seconds

Imagine a rare disease patient in NYC instantly getting help from specialists in Iceland & India who've seen similar cases

Built on @0GChain 🧵👇

## Tweet 2 - What It Does

🔬 MedNexus transforms isolated hospitals into a global intelligence network

✅ AI-powered case matching worldwide in <30 seconds
✅ Real-time cross-border medical consultations  
✅ Medical Intelligence NFTs (INFTs) for monetizing expertise
✅ Secure collaboration without exposing patient data

## Tweet 3 - The Problem/Reason

💔 The current problem:

- Critical medical knowledge trapped in hospital silos
- Rare disease patients suffer while solutions exist elsewhere
- Doctors can't easily collaborate across borders
- Research gets duplicated, wasting precious time & resources

We needed a "universal translator" for global medicine

## Tweet 4 - How It Was Built

🛠️ Built on @0GChain's complete infrastructure:

⛓️ Smart contracts for medical verification
🗄️ 0G Storage for encrypted patient data
⚡ 0G Compute for privacy-preserving AI
🔒 Full HIPAA compliance maintained
🌐 Real mainnet deployment (not testnet!)
