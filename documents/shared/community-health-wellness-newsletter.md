## HEART HEALTH AWARENESS: SIMPLE STEPS FOR A HEALTHIER HEART

### Understanding Heart Disease Risk Factors

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, but many cases are preventable through lifestyle modifications and early detection. Understanding your risk factors is the first step toward maintaining cardiovascular health.

#### Controllable Risk Factors:

- **High Blood Pressure**: Often called the "silent killer," high blood pressure can damage arteries over time
- **High Cholesterol**: Excess cholesterol can build up in arteries, restricting blood flow
- **Smoking**: Damages blood vessels and reduces oxygen in the blood
- **Diabetes**: High blood sugar can damage blood vessels and increase heart disease risk
- **Obesity**: Excess weight puts additional strain on the heart
- **Physical Inactivity**: Regular exercise strengthens the heart muscle
- **Poor Diet**: High sodium, saturated fat, and processed foods increase cardiovascular risk
- **Stress**: Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure and unhealthy behaviors

#### Non-Controllable Risk Factors:

- Age (men 45+, women 55+)
- Family history of heart disease
- Gender (men at higher risk at younger ages)
- Race and ethnicity (African Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans at higher risk)

### Prevention Strategies

#### 1. Maintain a Heart-Healthy Diet

- **Emphasize**: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats
- **Limit**: Sodium (less than 2,300mg daily), saturated fats, trans fats, and added sugars
- **Choose**: Baked, grilled, or steamed foods over fried options
- **Portion Control**: Use smaller plates and pay attention to serving sizes

#### 2. Stay Physically Active

- **Goal**: At least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly
- **Include**: Muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days per week
- **Start Small**: Even 10-minute walks can make a difference
- **Make It Fun**: Find activities you enjoy like dancing, swimming, or gardening

#### 3. Maintain a Healthy Weight

- **Calculate BMI**: Body Mass Index between 18.5-24.9 is considered healthy
- **Set Realistic Goals**: Aim for 1-2 pounds of weight loss per week if needed
- **Focus on Lifestyle**: Sustainable changes rather than quick fixes

#### 4. Don't Smoke or Use Tobacco

- **Quit Now**: Benefits begin within 24 hours of quitting
- **Seek Support**: Use quitlines, apps, or speak with healthcare providers
- **Avoid Secondhand Smoke**: Even passive exposure increases heart disease risk

#### 5. Limit Alcohol Consumption

- **Moderation**: Up to 1 drink daily for women, 2 for men
- **Know Your Limits**: Excessive alcohol can raise blood pressure and contribute to weight gain

#### 6. Manage Stress Effectively

- **Techniques**: Deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or regular exercise
- **Time Management**: Prioritize tasks and delegate when possible
- **Social Support**: Maintain relationships and seek help when needed
- **Professional Help**: Consider counseling for chronic stress or anxiety

#### 7. Get Quality Sleep

- **Duration**: 7-9 hours nightly for adults
- **Consistency**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily
- **Environment**: Cool, dark, quiet bedroom
- **Avoid**: Caffeine and electronics before bedtime

### Warning Signs of Heart Attack

**Immediate medical attention required if experiencing:**

- Chest pain or discomfort (pressure, squeezing, fullness)
- Pain or discomfort in arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach
- Shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort
- Cold sweats, nausea, or lightheadedness
- Unusual fatigue, especially in women

**Remember**: Call 911 immediately - don't drive yourself to the hospital
