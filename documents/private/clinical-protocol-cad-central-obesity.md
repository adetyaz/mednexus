## Background and Rationale

### Clinical Problem

Normal-BMI patients with increased waist circumference (WC) represent a frequently overlooked population at elevated cardiovascular risk. These patients, classified as having "invisible obesity," demonstrate significantly higher rates of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in male populations.

### Evidence Base

Recent prospective analysis of 644 normal-BMI CAD patients demonstrated that males in the highest WC tertile (>92.9 cm) showed:

- 2.21-fold increased risk of severe CAD (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.36-3.59)
- 2.54-fold higher one-year re-admission rate (HR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.33-4.83)
- Significantly elevated cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, dyslipidemia, and inflammatory markers

Gender-specific differences reveal that these associations are primarily observed in males, with limited corresponding risk elevation in female populations.

## Protocol Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. Standardize identification and risk stratification of normal-BMI patients with central obesity
2. Establish gender-specific treatment protocols for cardiovascular risk management
3. Implement systematic monitoring and follow-up procedures
4. Reduce one-year cardiovascular readmission rates

### Secondary Objectives

1. Optimize medical therapy based on individual risk profiles
2. Establish patient education protocols for "invisible obesity" awareness
3. Develop multidisciplinary care coordination pathways

## Patient Population

### Inclusion Criteria

- Age 18-83 years
- Body Mass Index: 18.5-23.9 kg/m²
- Confirmed coronary artery disease by angiography (≥50% stenosis in major vessel)
- Waist circumference measurements available

### Exclusion Criteria

- Active malignancy or life-limiting comorbidities
- Pregnancy or nursing
- Severe heart failure (NYHA Class IV)
- Recent trauma or acute inflammatory conditions
- Inability to provide informed consent

## Risk Stratification Protocol

### Anthropometric Assessment

#### Waist Circumference Measurements

**Technique:**

- Patient standing, minimal respiration
- Non-elastic tape at midpoint between lowest rib and iliac crest
- Measurement to nearest 0.1 cm
- Tape snug but not compressing skin

#### Gender-Specific Risk Tertiles

**Males:**

- Tertile 1 (Low Risk): <87.0 cm
- Tertile 2 (Intermediate Risk): 87.0-92.9 cm
- Tertile 3 (High Risk): >92.9 cm

**Females:**

- Tertile 1 (Low Risk): <81.0 cm
- Tertile 2 (Intermediate Risk): 81.0-86.9 cm
- Tertile 3 (High Risk): >86.9 cm

### Cardiovascular Risk Assessment

#### Laboratory Parameters (12-hour fasting)

- Lipid profile: Total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides
- Apolipoprotein A1 and B levels
- Fasting glucose and HbA1c
- High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)
- Serum uric acid levels
- Triglycerides-glucose index: ln(fasting TGs [mg/dL] × fasting glucose [mg/dL]/2)

#### Clinical Assessment

- Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)
- Family history of premature CAD
- Smoking status assessment
- Diabetes mellitus diagnosis
- Hypertension evaluation
- Dyslipidemia classification

### Angiographic Severity Assessment

#### Coronary Lesion Classification

- **Simple Lesions (Type A)**: Discrete, concentric, readily accessible
- **Complex Lesions (Type B/C)**: Eccentric, tortuous, calcified, long lesions

#### Disease Severity Scoring

**Gensini Score Calculation:**

- Degree of stenosis weighting: 50% = 1 point, 75% = 2 points, 90% = 4 points, 99% = 8 points, 100% = 16 points
- Location multiplier: LAD = 2.5, LCX = 2.5, RCA = 1.0, Left main = 5.0
- Severe CAD defined as top tertile Gensini score by gender

## Treatment Protocol

### High-Risk Male Patients (WC Tertile 3)

#### Immediate Management

1. **Enhanced Medical Therapy**

   - Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor)
   - High-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80mg or rosuvastatin 40mg)
   - ACE inhibitor or ARB optimization
   - Beta-blocker therapy as indicated

2. **Metabolic Intervention**
   - Diabetes management with target HbA1c <7.0%
   - Aggressive lipid control (LDL-C <70 mg/dL)
   - Blood pressure target <130/80 mmHg
   - Weight management counseling

#### Specialized Interventions

1. **Nutritional Assessment**

   - Registered dietitian consultation
   - Mediterranean diet education
   - Caloric restriction counseling (500-750 kcal/day deficit)
   - Visceral fat reduction strategies

2. **Exercise Prescription**
   - Supervised cardiac rehabilitation program
   - Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (150 min/week)
   - Resistance training (2-3 sessions/week)
   - Flexibility and balance training

### Intermediate-Risk Patients (WC Tertile 2)

#### Standard Care Plus

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**

   - Quarterly clinical assessments
   - Semi-annual laboratory evaluations
   - Annual echocardiography
   - Stress testing as clinically indicated

2. **Lifestyle Modification**
   - Dietary consultation
   - Physical activity counseling
   - Smoking cessation support
   - Weight maintenance strategies

### Low-Risk Patients (WC Tertile 1)

#### Standard Care

1. **Routine Follow-up**
   - Semi-annual clinical assessments
   - Annual laboratory evaluations
   - Standard cardiovascular risk factor modification
   - Patient education on weight stability

## Gender-Specific Considerations

### Male Patients

- Higher propensity for visceral fat accumulation
- Elevated inflammatory markers with increased WC
- Greater association between WC and severe CAD
- Enhanced metabolic dysfunction patterns

- Different adipokine profiles
- Menopause status consideration in post-menopausal women
