## Abstract

### Background

Lassa fever (LF) outbreaks in Nigeria have become increasingly frequent, with rising healthcare worker infections. Prevention depends on strict compliance with infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in treatment centers managing patients during active outbreak scenarios.

### Objective

To evaluate IPC practices during an ongoing LF outbreak in two major tertiary hospitals serving as referral LF treatment centers in north-central Nigeria, specifically focusing on adherence to NCDC viral hemorrhagic fever guidelines.

### Methods

Cross-sectional survey conducted by the IPC subteam of the National Rapid Response Team deployed to Plateau State during the 2019 LF outbreak. Data collected using standardized NCDC viral hemorrhagic fever isolation facility IPC survey tools across multiple assessment domains.

### Results

Both treatment centers possessed national VHF IPC isolation guidelines, however only 26.6% and 13.3% of healthcare workers respectively had received formal IPC training. Critical gaps identified included:

- **Infrastructure Deficiencies**: No clearly demarcated staff entry points for clinical areas after donning PPE
- **Protocol Gaps**: Absence of standard operating procedures for occupational exposure reporting
- **Training Limitations**: Inadequate IPC capacity building among healthcare workers
- **Governance Issues**: Poorly functional IPC committees for monitoring guideline compliance

### Key Findings by Assessment Domain

#### IPC Guidance and Training

- TC A: 4/15 staff (26.6%) received formal IPC training
- TC B: 2/15 staff (13.3%) received formal IPC training
- No regular onsite monthly training programs implemented
- Triage algorithms and patient escort protocols absent

#### Infrastructure Assessment

- TC A: Perimeter fencing and security present
- TC B: No perimeter security or access control
- Unidirectional flow patterns compromised in both facilities
- Inadequate visitor management areas
- Mixed suspect and confirmed case housing

#### PPE and Hand Hygiene

- Alcohol-based sanitizers and chlorine solutions available
- Daily preparation of 0.05% chlorine solution maintained
- Full PPE protocols not consistently followed by staff
- Cleaning staff lacking heavy-duty protective equipment

#### Environmental Controls

- Daily surface decontamination protocols followed
- Sharps containers available and properly sealed
- Waste management systems suboptimal (open barrel burning vs. proper incineration)
- Body fluid disposal procedures properly implemented

#### Equipment and Supplies

- Adequate fluid-resistant gowns and coveralls available
- Face shields, heavy-duty gloves, examination gloves in good repair
- TC A: Respirators adequate; TC B: Respirator deficiencies noted
- Individual patient thermometers and leak-proof waste bags maintained

#### Staff Health Monitoring

- No standardized daily staff screening protocols
- Temperature monitoring inconsistently implemented
- TC A: Previous staff LF infections documented
- Inadequate hydration facilities post-PPE removal

### Discussion

The assessment reveals significant gaps in IPC implementation despite availability of national guidelines. Key contributing factors identified:

**Systemic Challenges:**

- Insufficient funding for facility modifications to meet specifications
- Inadequate staffing levels for proper IPC implementation
- Limited technical support for healthcare worker capacity building
- Dysfunctional IPC governance structures

**Training Deficits:**
Evidence from 15 studies demonstrates IPC training association with reduced hospital-acquired infections. Current training coverage (13.3-26.6%) falls significantly below recommended standards for high-risk VHF management facilities.

**Infrastructure Limitations:**
Unidirectional flow compromised by structural constraints, waste management systems inadequate for high-containment requirements, and visitor access controls insufficient for outbreak conditions.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**

   - Establish functional IPC committees with clear oversight mandates
   - Implement weekly onsite training programs for all clinical staff
   - Develop standardized occupational exposure reporting protocols
   - Install proper waste incineration systems

2. **Medium-term Improvements:**

   - Facility renovations to achieve unidirectional flow patterns
   - Enhanced PPE donning/doffing areas with proper supervision
   - Daily staff health screening implementation
   - Increased healthcare worker staffing levels

3. **Long-term Sustainability:**
   - Government financial support for infrastructure upgrades
   - Regular technical assistance from NCDC and partner agencies
   - Periodic IPC assessment protocols for all VHF treatment centers
   - Integration of IPC standards into healthcare worker certification

### Clinical Implications

Healthcare facility avoidance during outbreaks due to perceived safety concerns can facilitate community transmission. Robust IPC implementation builds public confidence and ensures effective outbreak containment while protecting healthcare workers on the front lines.

### Limitations

Findings cannot be generalized to all Nigerian treatment centers. Some assessment data could not be independently verified by research team due to outbreak response time constraints.

### Conclusion

Implementation of existing IPC guidelines in Plateau State LF treatment centers requires immediate attention. Periodic assessments, enhanced training programs, and systematic compliance monitoring are essential for effective Lassa fever control in Nigeria's healthcare system.
